            <h2>
                Design Reflection
            </h2>
            <p>
                When I was designing this website, I intended to create a clean, modern website which is consistent
                across pages using a minimalist design allowing for the content to be comfortable and easy to read. The
                ways in which this influenced the design of the website are outlined underneath the <a
                    href="#aesthetics">aesthetics</a> subheading while the ways in which this was actually achieved are
                outlined under the <a href="#technical">technical aspects</a> subheading. I found that designing a
                simple, clean website inherently made for an accessible websites but there are other extra features I
                have utilised to make the website accessible which are all described under the <a
                    href="#accessibility">accessibility</a> subheading.
                I personally think that I achieved my goal of creating a modern, consistent website well and, as a
                result, I am personally very satisfied with the end result and I am hopeful that you agree.
            </p>
            <p>
                If I were to continue improving this website into the future and I were allowed to use JavaScript, the
                first thing I would attempt to add would be a light mode. Although I personally believe that dark colour
                schemes like the one present on this website look cleaner and are generally considered better for
                readability, there are use cases in which people may prefer light modes such as when attempting to view
                content outside in the sun or in other light environments. Implementing this would also further improve
                the accessibility of the website as individuals with a condition called astigmatism sometimes struggle
                to read content when designed to only support a dark mode as this leads to excessive blurriness in their
                vision.
            </p>
            <h2>
                Technical Aspects
            </h2>
            <p>
                Each page on this website consists of three main sections that form each page; the navigation bar, the
                body/article and the footer. To ensure that my aforementioned goal of consistency was achieved in this
                regard, the navigation bar and footer are consistent between pages. Each of these sections are separated
                by a horizontal line to create a visual distinction between the sections while also just looking good
                <span class="description">(in my opinion at least)</span>.
            </p>
            <p>
                One issue I had with this design was that the footer would be placed directly after the text in the
                article
                for each page which, on most pages, was not an issue with the only exception on devices I tested with
                being
                the home page. After testing many potential solutions which all had flaws such as straight up not
                working or
                resulting in the footer overlapping with other text, the solution I found was to create a flexbox which
                was
                given a minimum size of at least 100vh which is CSS-speak for the whole screen. This resulted in the
                footer
                being placed at either the very bottom of the page if the content is less than a whole screen or at the
                bottom of the article if it is long enough. This is displayed in the two following images which have
                borders
                added to demonstrate where the edge of the screen is.
            </p>
            <img src="img/flex.png" alt="This website with the footer at the bottom of the screen">
            <p class="caption" alt="This website with the footer at the bottom of the article">Website with the flexbox
                enabled placing the footer at the bottom.</p>
            <img src="img/noflex.png">
            <p class="caption">Website without the flexbox enabled placing the footer below the text.</p>
            <p>
                Another element that I decided to design using flexbox was the navigation bar. The method that <a
                    href="https://www.w3schools.com/css/css_navbar_horizontal.asp">w3schools recommends</a> to create a
                horizontal navigation bar involves floating the elements in a list. I found that using flexbox instead
                of floating the list made for designing the navigation bar to be much less painful. I admit that my
                issues
                with float were probably just my own incompetence but it resulted in a navigation bar that wasn't
                centred
                properly. Thankfully, after switching over to flexbox, all of my problems were solved resulting in a
                navigation bar that was painless to create while being centred with each element being evenly spaced.
                Above all else, flexbox just sounds
                cooler than float.
            </p>
            <p>
                Another major technical design aspect for this website is how it responds to differently sized viewports
                allowing for it to be just as functional on a laptop or desktop with a large screen as it is on a tiny
                mobile phone. This was achieved by first allowing the web browser to modify the scale of the content
                on the website through placing the line <code>&ltmeta name="viewport"
                    content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"&gt</code>
                at the top of each HTML file. With just this line, I found that the margins were still far too large on
                mobile
                devices to be an acceptable solution by itself. This was solved through the use of the min() function
                inside my CSS for the horizontal line, images and text. Specifically, the maximum width of all these
                elements are either 95% of the viewport's width or 500px depending on which is smaller. The end result
                is a responsive website that is usable on both small and large screens.

                other screenshots of this website use the desktop UI.</p>
            </p>
            <p>
                When designing this website, I used a number of classes to ensure that the correct elements are styled
                in
                the correct way allowing me to make the website look the way that I want it to. The classes used
                throughout
                the creation of this website are shown in the following table.
            </p>
            <table>
                <tr class="columntitle">
                    <td>Class</td>
                    <td>Purpose</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td class="rowtitle">columntitle</td>
                    <td>Used to colour the top element of each column in a table pink and make it bold.</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td class="rowtitle">rowtitle</td>
                    <td>Used to colour the left-most element of each row in a table blue and make it bold.</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td class="rowtitle">nav</td>
                    <td>Used to design the navigation bar at the top of each page.</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td class="rowtitle">centretext</td>
                    <td>Used in a div that wraps around all text on every page and ensures that all text is centred and
                        aligned while the margins are the correct size depending on the size of the screen.
                    </td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td class="rowtitle">caption</td>
                    <td>Used to style the centred, grey text underneath each image. Although this looks identical to
                        elements with the pagedescription ID, I chose to use a separate class because IDs can only be
                        used once per page and I may want to design the page description separately from the caption in
                        the future.</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td class="rowtitle">description</td>
                    <td>Used for the greyed out text that is used with spans during paragraphs for less
                        important information <span class="description">like this</span>. The purpose of this is further
                        explained in the <a href="#aesthetics">aesthetics</a> section.</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td class="rowtitle">tall</td>
                    <td>Used for any images with an aspect ratio where the height is greater than the width. This is
                        only used for the screenshot of the mobile UI above and was necessary because the image was too
                        tall otherwise hence the name of the class.</td>
                </tr>
            </table>
            <p>
                Additionally, a number of IDs were used throughout the page both as anchors for navigation and for
                styling elements that only appear once per page.
            </p>
            <table>

            </h2>
            <p>
                The colour scheme for this website was entirely based on the colour scheme called "Noel" for Visual
                Studio Code which was made for me by a friend of mine who goes by
                <a href="https://github.com/lunacookies/">lunacookies on Github</a>. As a connoisseur of colour schemes,
                she
                designed Noel to be a low contrast colour scheme with visually appealing colours based on the GMK keycap
                set
                with the same name. The fact that the colours were designed with comfortable reading in mind (and the
                fact that they
                were chosen specifically for me) made this colour scheme an easy choice for the website.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div class="centretext">
            <p>
                When choosing where to place each of the colours on the website, I decided on a hierarchical approach
                with pink
                elements being the most important like heading 1 followed by blue elements like heading 2 then white
                elements like standard
                text inside paragraphs with grey text being the least important. This follows the design principles of
                the colour scheme these colours were based on such as how the pink and blue are used for types and the
                grey is used
                for comments. From showing friends and family my website, a frequent piece of feedback I got was that
                the grey may be hard to read for some users. in order to minimise the impact of this, I made sure to use
                this
                colour sparingly and only in parts where the information is otherwise available. For instance, the page
                description between
                headings 1 and 2 is in grey but is also just a summary of the contents of the page meaning that users
                will be able to get the same information that the grey text gives by looking at the subheadings or by
                reading the
                text on the page. Other instances of grey text occurring inside paragraphs are used only to add extra
                information in somewhat of a tangent to what the paragraph is actually discussing ensuring that users
                who, for
                whatever reason, cannot read this dark text are not actually missing out on much and are still able to
                understand the topic of the paragraph. All of these design considerations ensure that colour is used to
                structure
                the website in an easy to understand manner while staying true to the original colour scheme's design
                decisions

                One of the more potentially confusing choices
                <span class="description">(that, ideally, you didn't even realise)</span>
                is the choice to have the scroll bar always display on browsers that don't hide it like
                Safari even when the page is not long enough to require a scroll bar. This choice was made because, at
                least on Chrome, the scroll bar actually changes the placement of the content on the screen very
                slightly. As one of the goals when creating this website was consistency, having content shifted across
                on certain pages made for inconsistent alignment between pages which manifested itself as content
                appearing to shift around when navigating the website.

            Two screenshots of this website. The top has the scroll bar while the bottom does not. Take note that the
            added white lines do not line up. The top one is consistent with the pages that have more content while the
            bottom one is not.

        <div class="centretext">
            <p>
                Another part of ensuring consistency throughout the design of the website extends beyond the website
                itself and into consistency with the operating system that you are running whether that be Windows,
                macOS, Linux, Android or iOS. Consistency between website and OS was achieved through the use of the
                system-ui font family. What this does is select the font based on what operating system you are running
                by selecting the font that is used for the UI of your operating system. These fonts, as far as I am
                aware,
                are all sans-serif fonts and are designed for readability and comfort as these operating systems are
                created with users who are going to use them for long periods of time in mind. The legibility and
                consistency granted by the use of the system-ui font family made it an obvious and easy choice when
                choosing what font or fonts to use.
            </p>
            <p>
                An important part of making the content on this website as easy to read as possible was the use
                of whitespace <span class="description">(or greyspace in my case?)</span> in both the margins and
                between each
                element. Although many may consider the margins particularly wide compared to what they may be used to,
                I personally find that margins of this size result in lines containing just the right number of
                characters
                for easy reading without feeling overwhelmed by the length of each line. Thankfully,
                <a href="https://baymard.com/blog/line-length-readability">typographers agree</a> that the ideal line
                length
                is within the range of 50-75 characters which my website perfectly falls within. In addition to margins,
                whitespace is placed between all elements including paragraphs, images and headers. Unlike the margins,
                there isn't any typographical reason behind the amount of whitespace between elements except I just
                think
                it looks right. The amount of padding between elements was chosen by settling on a value that allows for
                a comfortable amount of space between elements while not being a ridiculous distance apart.

                Accessibility
            </h2>
            <p>
                In order to ensure that this website is as accessible as possible, I decided to structure the website
                in a manner that facilitated easy keyboard navigation and support for screen readers. When creating this
                website,
                as I have mentioned previously, consistency across all pages was a core goal when designing and writing
                content.
                A part of making the website consistent involved designing a navigation bar that is always in the same
                position
                on the page with the same contents in the same order. Because this navigation bar is always at the top
                of the page,
                the entire website is quick and easy to navigate between pages using just the tab and enter keys.

                To support users with impaired vision, I ensured that the website is compatible with screen readers.
                This involved using
                a consistent heading structure throughout the website which allows blind users to know what each section
                is about along with
                using the alt text feature for any images. This means that, when combined with the image captions that
                are visible below each image,
                users who are blind should be able to understand the content and significance of any images placed
                within my website.

                Although not specifically a part of making the website usable for users with disabilities, as explained
                in the technical aspects section above, this website responsively resizes content depending on the size
                of the screen being used to view it. This means that anyone is able to use the website regardless of
                device allowing it to be vastly more accessible even if users do not have access to a specific type of
                device whether that be a phone or a laptop.
