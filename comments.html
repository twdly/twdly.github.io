            The colour scheme for this website was entirely based on the colour scheme called "Noel" for Visual Studio
            Code which was made for me by a friend of mine who goes by
            <a href="https://github.com/lunacookies/">lunacookies on Github</a>. As a connoisseur of colour schemes, she
            designed Noel to be a low contrast colour scheme with visually appealing colours based on the GMK keycap set
            with the same
            name. The fact that the colours were designed with comfortable reading in mind (and the fact that they were
            chosen specifically for me) made this colour scheme an easy choice for the website.
