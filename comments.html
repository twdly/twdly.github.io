                The colour scheme for this website was entirely based on the colour scheme called "Noel" for Visual
                Studio
                Code which was made for me by a friend of mine who goes by
                <a href="https://github.com/lunacookies/">lunacookies on Github</a>. As a connoisseur of colour schemes,
                she
                designed Noel to be a low contrast colour scheme with visually appealing colours based on the GMK keycap
                set
                with the same
                name. The fact that the colours were designed with comfortable reading in mind (and the fact that they
                were
                chosen specifically for me) made this colour scheme an easy choice for the website.

                One of the more potentially confusing choices <span class="description">(that you potentially didn't
                    even
                    realise)</span> is the choice to have the scroll bar always display on browsers that don't hide it
                like
                Safari even when the page is not long enough to require a scroll bar. This choice was made because, at
                least
                on Chrome, the scroll bar actually changes the placement of the content on the screen very slightly. As
                one
                of the goals when creating this website was consistency, having content shifted across on certain pages
                made
                for inconsistent alignment between pages which manifested itself as content appearing to shift around
                when
                navigating the website.

            Two screenshots of this website. The top has the scroll bar while the bottom does not. Take note that the
            added white lines do not line up. The top one is consistent with the pages that have more content while the
            bottom one is not.
