                Design Reflection
            </h2>
            <p>
                When I was designing this website, I intended to create a clean, modern website which is consistent
                across pages using a minimalist design allowing for the content to be comfortable and easy to read. The
                ways in which this influenced the design of the website are outlined underneath the <a
                    href="#aesthetics">aesthetics</a> subheading while the ways in which this was actually achieved are
                outlined under the <a href="#technical">technical aspects</a> subheading. I found that designing a
                simple, clean website inherently made for an accessible websites but there are other extra features I
                have utilised to make the website accessible which are all described under the <a
                    href="#accessibility">accessibility</a> subheading.
                I personally think that I achieved my goal of creating a modern, consistent website well and, as a
                result, I am personally very satisfied with the end result and I am hopeful that you agree.
            </p>
            <p>
                If I were to continue improving this website into the future and I were allowed to use JavaScript, the
                first thing I would attempt to add would be a light mode. Although I personally believe that dark colour
                schemes like the one present on this website look cleaner and are generally considered better for
                readability, there are use cases in which people may prefer light modes such as when attempting to view
                content outside in the sun or in other light environments. Implementing this would also further improve 
                the accessibility of the website as individuals with a condition called astigmatism sometimes struggle
                to read content when designed to only support a dark mode as this leads to excessive blurriness in their vision.

            <p>
                The colour scheme for this website was entirely based on the colour scheme called "Noel" for Visual
                Studio Code which was made for me by a friend of mine who goes by
                <a href="https://github.com/lunacookies/">lunacookies on Github</a>. As a connoisseur of colour schemes,
                she
                designed Noel to be a low contrast colour scheme with visually appealing colours based on the GMK keycap
                set
                with the same name. The fact that the colours were designed with comfortable reading in mind (and the
                fact that they
                were chosen specifically for me) made this colour scheme an easy choice for the website.

                One of the more potentially confusing choices
                <span class="description">(that, ideally, you didn't even realise)</span>
                is the choice to have the scroll bar always display on browsers that don't hide it like
                Safari even when the page is not long enough to require a scroll bar. This choice was made because, at
                least on Chrome, the scroll bar actually changes the placement of the content on the screen very
                slightly. As one of the goals when creating this website was consistency, having content shifted across
                on certain pages made for inconsistent alignment between pages which manifested itself as content
                appearing to shift around when navigating the website.

            Two screenshots of this website. The top has the scroll bar while the bottom does not. Take note that the
            added white lines do not line up. The top one is consistent with the pages that have more content while the
            bottom one is not.

            <p>
                In order to ensure that this website is as accessible as possible, I decided to structure the website
                in a manner that facilitated easy keyboard navigation and support for screen readers. When creating this
                website,
                as I have mentioned previously, consistency across all pages was a core goal when designing and writing
                content.
                A part of making the website consistent involved designing a navigation bar that is always in the same
                position
                on the page with the same contents in the same order. Because this navigation bar is always at the top
                of the page,
                the entire website is quick and easy to navigate between pages using just the tab and enter keys.
            </p>
            <p>
                To support users with impaired vision, I ensured that the website is compatible with screen readers.
                This involved using
                a consistent heading structure throughout the website which allows blind users to know what each section
                is about along with
                using the alt text feature for any images. This means that, when combined with the image captions that
                are visible below each image,
                users who are blind should be able to understand the content and significance of any images placed
                within my website.
