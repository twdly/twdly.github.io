            <p>
                As a part of UTS's BIT Co-op program, I am able to gain valuable industry experience through
                internships that are organised by the university. I will be required to do my first internship
                during the next semester and my second during the first semester of my third year. I am able to
                choose from any of <a
                    href="https://www.uts.edu.au/about/faculty-engineering-and-information-technology/bachelor-information-technology-co-operative-scholarship/our-industry-sponsors/bit-sponsors">the
                    program's sponsors</a> but my current preference list is:
            </p>
            <ol>
                <li>Campaign Monitor</li>
                <li>TAL</li>
                <li>AMP</li>
            </ol>
            <p>
                I am very excited to be able to start my internship and be able to experience what it is actually
                like working in the IT industry and, hopefully, improving my own technical skills along the way.
            </p>
            <p>
                In addition to internships, I will still be working my way through my degree at university and this
                includes my choice of major. Although my thoughts may change as I gain more experience but I am
                currently intending to major in <a href="https://handbook.uts.edu.au/directory/smj03036.html">Enterprise
                    Systems Development</a>
                as this path will allow me to further my understanding of C# and .net whilst allowing me to pick up
                Swift
                for iOS
                development and, in general, improve my programming skills.
