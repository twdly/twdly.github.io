            Early Days
        </h2>
        <p>
            My passion for computers, like many others I'd assume, began with playing games from a young age.
            I still remember watching dad play Crash Bandicoot 2 on our PS2 which was the newest console for the time.
            The first console that I ever owned myself was a DS Lite which I used to put an extensive amount of time
            into various games across numerous franchises with the most notable ones being Mario and Pokemon.

            Sometime during 2015 or 2016, I stumbled across a video of someone building a PC. 
            Although I can no longer find the video, I distinctly remember it involving the person building the 
            PC spray painting all the components green. It was this video that made me want to build my own
            computer. Several years later, at the end of 2019, I had successfully researched and procured the parts
            to my first PC build with the specs as follows:

        <p>
            Over the past several years, I have completed various projects both inside and outside of school and
            univeristy.
            Examples of my previous projects are as follows:
