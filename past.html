        <p>
            My passion for computers, like many others I'd assume, began with playing games from a young age.
            I still remember watching dad play Crash Bandicoot 2 on our PS2 which was the newest console for the time.
            The first console that I ever owned myself was a DS Lite which I used to put an extensive amount of time
            into various games across numerous franchises with the most notable ones being Mario and Pokemon.

            Past Programming Projects

        <p>
            Over the past several years, I have completed various projects both inside and outside of school and
            univeristy.
            Examples of my previous projects are as follows:
