This is the repository for my Web Assignment for 31268 Web Systems at uni. This repository will contain all relevant code for this project.
The colours used for this website are derivative from [my favourite colour scheme](https://github.com/arzg/noel/) made by [my friend](https://github.com/arzg/).
The aforementioned colour scheme is, in turn, inspired by the [GMK Noel keycap set](https://gmknoel.com/).
